## example-app

For development, we use the [example-app](./example-app) generated with [Angular CLI](https://github.com/angular/angular-cli) version 1.6.6.
In this project, you can find the various use cases of the library and how example configurations might look like.
As the project evolves, we will try to keep up with the latest angular-cli and ngrx releases to ensure compatibility.

**For development**
* Run `ng serve` for a dev server. Navigate to `http://localhost:4200/`. The app will automatically reload if you change any of the source files.
* Run `ng test` to execute the unit tests via [Karma](https://karma-runner.github.io).
* Run `ng e2e` to execute the end-to-end tests via [Protractor](http://www.protractortest.org/).
